## Features

- Have a pre-populated `README.md` file for the new project.

## How to use

Install Faber CLI globally:

```shell
npm i -g faber-cli
```

Create a new project with this boilerplate:

```shell
faber create awesome-project https://github.com/faberjs/faber-demo.git
```

Paste this minified JSON data when prompted:
